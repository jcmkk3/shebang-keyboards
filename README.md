# !#/keyboards/
A collection of keyboards I'm working on, generated using [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen)

### ⚠️ These keyboards have not been tested yet

The `pcb` and `gerber` folders for each keyboard contain the routed PCBs.  
`ergogen` contains the Ergogen yaml each layout was generated from.

To generate the PCBs from scratch to `ergogen/output` run;  
`npm install && npm run gen`
